# csv-to-json

This app converts a CSV file to JSON. It was made specifically to be working with 
'customer-data.csv' file, so it may not work / work improperly with other files.

It requires a command-line argument with file's name to run - i.e., 'node app.js customer-data.csv'.
The user also can indicate the output file's name, but it's not really required.
